        q: 'How does the retainer billing software work exactly?',
        a: 'You set up a billing profile for a client: the retainer amount, the billing date, and the payment terms. The system generates and sends the invoice automatically every month. If you log out-of-scope overages during the month, they are automatically appended to the next invoice.',

        a: 'Your whole team can use it. You control who can create invoices, who can view client financials, and who has admin rights. It is perfect for agencies where Account Managers handle billing but founders want oversight.',

        q: 'Does it really support a white-label client portal?',

        q: 'What makes this better than other invoicing software for agencies?',
        a: 'Most invoicing tools are built for solo freelancers or accountants. We built this specifically for marketing agencies. Retainer automation, overage tracking to prevent scope creep, and white-label portals come standard.',

        q: 'Does it handle client billing for marketing agencies with complex projects?',
        a: 'Yes. You can bill flat retainers, hourly rates, or project-based milestones. You can add expenses and time entries to any invoice seamlessly.',
