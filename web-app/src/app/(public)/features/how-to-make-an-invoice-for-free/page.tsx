NobleInvoice has a field for every single one."

                  a: "An invoice is sent before payment — it's a request for money owed. A receipt is issued after payment as proof the transaction occurred. They're opposites in the payment timeline."

                  a: "A proforma invoice is a preliminary document sent before work begins. It outlines what you plan to charge but is not an actual payment request. Think of it as a formal quote in invoice format — useful for getting client sign-off before you start."

VAT-registered businesses may have additional required fields under local tax law, but for most independent professionals, a clear invoice with all the standard fields is perfectly sufficient."
